Description: command line audio splitter based on FFmpeg
 FFcuesplitter is a powerful, multi-platform CUE sheet splitter
 based on FFmpeg. Splits big audio tracks and automatically embeds
 tags using the information contained in the associated "CUE" sheet.
 It supports multiple CUE sheet encodings and many input formats
 (due to FFmpeg), including proprietary APE format, without need
 installing extra audio libs and packages. It has the ability to
 accept both files and directories as input while also working in
 recursive mode. It can be used either as a Python library or
 from the command line.
