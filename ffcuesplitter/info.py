entirely based on FFmpeg. Splits big audio tracks and automatically embeds tags
using the information contained in the associated **"CUE"** sheet. It supports
multiple CUE sheet encodings and many input formats (due to FFmpeg), including
APE format, without need installing extra audio libs and packages. It has the
ability to accept both files and directories as input while also working in
recursive mode. Can be used both as a Python module or by command line."""
